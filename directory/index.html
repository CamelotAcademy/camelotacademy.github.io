		<p><strong>Travel:</strong>

		</p>
		<p><strong>More About Me:</strong>
			Hi, everybody!  I am a career early educator who has worked with children ages 2 through 10 in many different settings. I came to early education almost by accident, when my Americorps program placed me in a Kindergarten classroom at a Boston turnaround school. I immediately fell in love with the unrestrained enthusiasm that kindergarteners bring to the world and I am inspired to match that enthusiasm everyday in my work with young people. I continued to work with children for the next 16 years, in private daycare cooperatives, residential programs, summer camps, and finally again in public school where I worked for 8 years as an assistant Kindergarten teacher. Over time I became disheartened by the increasing focus in public schools on academic readiness and skill practice at the expense of play and open-ended discovery.  When my family and I moved to the triangle two years ago I resolved to take a break from teaching until I could find a program that valued the learning potential in free play and exploration. Luckily I discovered Camelot and the Nature Start program and was able to join the team this year as a teacher. When I am not working outdoors with our students I am likely playing in the river with my own kids, biking, running, or pursuing more “indoor” hobbies like board games or afro-brazilian drumming.

		<p>
			Having grown up on the beaches of Central Florida, my passion for outdoor education and experiential learning has always run deep. After moving to North Carolina to pursue my M.S. in Environmental Engineering, I studied water and wastewater through a public health lens, including some time spent on field work in Southeast India. Later, I spent several years coordinating year-round outdoor camps before I made my way to Camelot, where I have had the opportunity to share my love for nature, engineering, and hands-on learning. In my free time, I love to cook and spend time with my two lovely senior dogs.

		<h4>MAPP teacher</h4>
		<em>Teaching since 2002; at Camelot since 2019</em>
		<br /><br />
		<p><strong>Education:</strong>
			With 22 years of teaching experience under my belt, I’ve spent the first part of my career bringing the magic of performing arts to upper-grade students. After COVID reshaped the world (and many of us right along with it), I followed my heart into the joyful, curious world of early childhood education—specifically kindergarten through second grade.
		</p>
		<p></p>
			I’m passionate about structured literacy and believe that strong, evidence-based foundations in reading open every door for young learners. I also believe in the power of picture books to spark imagination, build connection, and anchor meaningful lessons.
		<p></p>
			My classroom is a place where “wonder” isn’t just welcomed—it’s encouraged to lead the way. Lessons often take delightful detours thanks to curious questions, big ideas, and kid-led conversations. I consider it a privilege to learn alongside my students as we explore, laugh, create, and grow together each day.
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>More About Me:</strong>
			When I'm not teaching or finding my new favorite picture book, I love spending time with my family, quilting, talking to my plants, baking cake and eating cake.
