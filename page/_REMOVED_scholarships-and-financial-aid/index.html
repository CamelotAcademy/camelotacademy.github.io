	<strong>Tuition, Financial Aid, Loans &amp; Scholarships </strong><br />
<br />
Camelot Academy&rsquo;s tuition for the <!-- @update --->2020-2021 school year ranges from <!-- @update --->$10,900 to <!-- @update --->$16,350, depending on the grade level of the student. Tuition may be paid in full, by school-based installment plan (two or four payments) or with extended payments via Tuition Solution (<a href="http://www.tuitionsolution.com/"><strong>www.TuitionSolution.com</strong></a><strong> or&nbsp; 1-800-920-9777).&nbsp; </strong>International student tuition and fees are distinct and are based on the number of language-supported classes a student takes in a given semester.<br />
<br />
Camelot Academy offers a limited amount of school-sponsored financial aid to qualifying families on a first come, first served basis. Inquiries are acted upon once an admission application has been filed and a student visit completed. About 50% of the 2017-2018 student body received some form of tuition discount. Interested families should request financial aid forms when they file their student&#39;s application. The financial aid forms are then returned to the school with a copy of the most recent 1040 form for each wage earner in the family.<br />
<br />
A typical award for a family qualifying for financial aid is $1,000 - $2,000 off the annual tuition.<br />
<br />
Families enrolling a second child at Camelot Academy receive a 5% sibling discount.<br />
<br />
Camelot Academy is approved by the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority (NCSEAA) to participate in both the Opportunity Scholarship Program and the Disabilities Grant Program.&nbsp; The State determines eligibility and awards for students transferring to our school from a public school setting.&nbsp; More information is available here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ncseaa.edu/OSG.htm">http://www.ncseaa.edu/OSG.htm</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Chris De Carlo Scholarship</strong>, named for the father of Camelot&rsquo;s Founding Director,&nbsp; is awarded based on academic potential and financial need. Consideration is given to standardized test scores, academic records, letters of recommendation, essay, financial need as well as artistic and/or athletic talent. Chris De Carlo Scholarships range from $1,000 to $4,000 depending on the need, ability and potential of the applicant. Open to rising 4th grade through 11th-grade students.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Excalibur Award</strong> is based on nationally-normed standardized testing completed during the admissions process. Students may qualify for this award by scoring in the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher on <em>either</em> the language arts or the math assessments. Each award is $1,000 per year and open to rising 4<sup>th</sup> through 11<sup>th</sup> grade students.<br />
<br />
<b>The Round-Table Scholarship</b>&nbsp;is based on nationally-normed standardized testing done during the admissions process. Qualifying students must score in the 98<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;percentile or higher for&nbsp;<i>both</i>&nbsp;math and language arts&nbsp;and be a student in good standing at Camelot Academy for at least one year. Round-Table Scholars receive a 50% tuition award. Camelot supports a maximum of six Round-Table Scholars in any given school year.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Julian Stanley Scholarship</strong>, named for the talent-search pioneer, Dr. Julian Stanley, is a full-tuition scholarship. It is awarded to one newly enrolled Upper School (8<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup> grade) student per year. The successful candidate will have a 7<sup>th</sup> grade SAT score that meets or exceeds the criteria for the Grand Reception Ceremony at Duke TIP, in addition to supporting records of outstanding academic and behavioral standing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The Promise Award</strong> is offered to incoming members of the Camelot Academy Class of 2029 (Kindergarten 2017-18).&nbsp; It is a merit award that grows with your child, increasing $500 a year over 13 years &ndash; a $45,000 opportunity for the student who attends Camelot, Kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Great Beginnings Award </strong>is offered to incoming first through third grade families. It is a flat $2,500 discount of the posted tuition for as long as the student remains at Camelot Academy.&nbsp; Limited availability - first-come, first-served.<br />
<br />
All scholarships are renewable, as long as the student maintains a high level of academic performance and remains a student in good standing. Camelot Academy reserves the right to limit or cap the number of scholarships awarded to a class, grade level or division of the school. All scholarships are available only at the time of enrollment for students entering at Grade Four or higher (except for &lsquo;The Promise&rsquo; and &lsquo;Great Beginnings&rsquo; Awards). All students who enter the school in grades K through 3 are considered for merit-based scholarships, based on nationally-normed standardized testing administered in the spring of 3<sup>rd</sup> grade. More than 50% of the 2017-2018 student body received either a merit-based scholarship or tuition assistance based on need.<br />
