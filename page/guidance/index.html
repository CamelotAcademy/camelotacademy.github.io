Camelot teachers and staff all share a strong commitment to the holistic well-being of our students; indeed, teaching students how to be happy, healthy human beings who make meaningful contributions to their communities is central to our mission as educators. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Camelot establishes a theme for each school year to facilitate the accomplishment of this mission.&nbsp; The 2017-18 theme is Roots; we&rsquo;re covering cultural, historical, biological, psychological, and ethical origins of who we are as individuals and as a community.&nbsp; Some previous themes were Balance, Zoom (social thinking and perspective-taking), and What&rsquo;s Love Got to Do with It?&nbsp; Students participate in class activities each week which provide structured opportunities to engage more deeply with knowledge and skills related to the theme.<br />
<br />
MAPP students have a dedicated curriculum to learn about virtues such as honesty, responsibility, and fairness; across all grade levels, we proactively teach manners and common courtesy, as well as constructive ways of dealing with social conflict through both formal curriculum and informal guidance.<br />
<br />
Camelot works collaboratively with consulting professionals regarding the psychological needs of our students, as well as physical/developmental needs.&nbsp;<!--@update As of the 2018-19 school year w-->We also have a full time professional counselor on staff to enhance our service to students and their families.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>College/Career Counseling</strong></u><br />
<br />
Camelot works closely and collaboratively with each student throughout the last three semesters of their high school career to ensure that students pursue a path post-Camelot that matches up with their goals, interests, values, and strengths. College planning is seen as a capstone project that reinforces our school tenet of parents, teachers, and students collaborating.<br />
<br />
This work is more than preparation for college; it is preparation for life.<br />
<br />
This preparation begins in KinderMAPP; students are exposed to acknowledgements of college acceptances during Morning Meeting, interact with older students during multi-age activities, and participate in our annual graduation ceremony. Middle Graders learn student skills such as note-taking, organization, and research. Upper School ramps up the workload and research expectations become more stringent. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In grades 9-12, students learn the importance of GPA, sit in on college information sessions with college reps, and visit college campuses. Students are also encouraged to take honors and AP classes as appropriate, and there are dual enrollment options at UNC-Chapel Hill for seniors who wish to take a college class while still in high school. Optional test prep classes are also periodically offered.<br />
<br />
Camelot works very closely with seniors during the college application process to ensure that students identify and apply to colleges that fit them well, and also to help those students present themselves well to the institutions to which they apply. Common Application prompts are discussed in the spring of junior year, and students write two drafts of Common App essays before the start of their senior year. Throughout senior year, students are guided through the college selection and application process step-by-step; Camelot staff proofreads applications, gives feedback on essays, and conducts interviews that allow for constructive feedback on presenting oneself most effectively in-person.<br />
<br />
We also assist students in identifying and applying for merit-based financial aid; Camelot graduates typically receive financial aid packages worth more than the total cost of four years of tuition in our Upper School. In this way, Camelot is not just an excellent educational investment, but a financial one as well.<br />
