	<h3><br />
A Common Sense Approach</h3>

<p>Mastery-Based Learning (pioneered by Dr. Benjamin Bloom) enables all students to achieve to the highest level of their ability, while ensuring that no student moves on without mastering key concepts needed for future success. Camelot&#39;s Founding Director, Thelma De Carlo-Glynn, believes this common sense approach, while not commonly practiced, is the key to unlocking potential in all students.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#more-commonsense').toggle();">MORE</a>

<div id="more-commonsense" style="display:none">&nbsp;
<p>How does the theory work in practice? Each student is given a pretest so the teacher can determine existing skills and knowledge. Instruction begins where demonstrated mastery ends. As the student works through new material, the teacher provides instruction, feedback and guidance. This may occur during one-on-one sessions, in small groups, or with the whole class. At appropriate intervals, the student undergoes assessment activities/testing to evaluate mastery of the material. Demonstrated mastery - a score of 80% or better - allows the student to move on from that material. Any performance below the mastery level results in the student returning to the material for further study and instruction. While mastery-based learning allows the academically gifted student to move through material at an accelerated pace, and thus remain challenged, it also prevents students from &quot;falling through the cracks.&quot;</p>
</div>
<br />

<h3>It&#39;s All About YOU</h3>

<p>&#39;Individualization&#39; is one of those buzz words that educators often use when discussing best practices. Everyone agrees it&#39;s a good thing but in reality it is a very labor-intensive promise to deliver on. True individualization requires both small classes and a small school with a commitment to sustained flexibility and reflective practice.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#more-individualization').toggle();">MORE</a>

<div id="more-individualization" style="display:none">&nbsp;
<p>Camelot Academy, with a K-12 population of about 140 and an average class size of 11 is small by design, but its commitment to a &lsquo;tailor-made&rsquo; curriculum for each student goes beyond mere numbers. Consistent with its mastery-based approach, the school year at Camelot begins with a period of assessment for both new and returning students. Based on the results of these pre-assessments, teachers assemble Progress Plans for each student. Progress Plans detail the strengths and weaknesses of each student in each subject, as well as indicating what learning styles they favor and their social/emotional needs. Instead of using age or grade level as the sole determinant of what is taught and when, Camelot uses Progress Plans to help determine the right starting place for each student in each subject area. Progress Plans also provide a basis for discussion at the Parent-Teacher-Student conferences conducted each fall.</p>

<h3>Parents as Team-members</h3>

<p>We recognize that parental involvement is critical to student success. Parents are part of our team, with students and teachers being the other members. As with any team, there has to be communication, commitment and follow-through. We are committed to keeping parents informed about what happens in school through a system of meetings, written and informal communications. Similarly, we expect parents to respond to our communication and keep us apprised of any changes at home that may impact their child&#39;s performance in school. In addition, we host a number of events over the course of the school year which we label &#39;whole school events&#39; that include family members to reinforce the sense of community which anchors our &#39;team.&#39;</p>
<!---// Camelot also sponsors a dynamic <a href="/parent-education-series/">Parent Education Series</a> with topics suggested by our clientele.<br /> //--->

&nbsp;
<h3>People You&#39;d Love to Spend Several Years With</h3>

<p>Camelot Academy has attracted its faculty members from across the country and around the world. Several have won recognition in their chosen field, many have taught abroad &ndash; all have a passion for what they do. Time and again, when Camelot students are surveyed to determine the single most important aspect of the school for them, they cite the teachers.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#more-experienced').toggle();">MORE</a>

<div id="more-experienced" style="display:none">&nbsp;
<p>This rich aggregation of teaching talent is no accident. When a teaching position becomes available, the school does a worldwide search. Viable candidates are screened through telephone/Skype interviews and the most promising of these are invited to the school to teach a sample lesson. The Founding Director of Camelot Academy, Thelma De Carlo-Glynn, and at least one teacher attend the lesson and student feedback is solicited. Afterwards, the visiting teacher is invited to a meal with the rest of the Camelot faculty and staff and the vetting process continues. The attraction of Camelot Academy for teachers/candidates is not only the freedom to practice their craft without the hindrance of layers of bureaucracy or excessive test preparation; they are also empowered to try new things. At Camelot they will join a school community in which their thoughts, input and ideas are valued on all topics - no matter how large or small.</p>

<h3>What it Means to be &quot;Family&quot;</h3>

<p>While a student&#39;s academic progress is our measurable focus, providing a safe, nurturing environment that supports social and emotional growth is central to our mission and a factor we believe to be key to all student success. To that end, each day begins with our community time, which we call &#39;Morning Meeting.&#39; All students, as well as the faculty and staff, gather to discuss/celebrate what the day has in store, which often includes visitors, field trips, birthdays and college acceptances.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#more-family').toggle();">MORE</a>

<div id="more-family" style="display:none">&nbsp;
<p>The synergy of a K-12 school contributes to the family-like atmosphere, with older students frequently warming to the &#39;big brother&#39; or &#39;big sister&#39; roles younger students cast them in. These younger students also relish the opportunity to show &#39;the big kids&#39; what they are learning. Relationships and community are not taken for granted - they are part of the work we do.</p>

<p>Our Camelot days are fast-paced, but always deliberate and purposeful. The culture of the school is such that time is taken to recognize good manners, hard work and achievements as well as to genuinely care about the well-being of all.</p>

<h3>From Here to Everywhere - Excellent Results</h3>

<p>As a K-12 school, students of all grade levels benefit from the articulation of our academic goals from the primary grades to college and beyond. Our community is rich with the awareness of both scholastic and career opportunities that await our students in the Big World. We have frequent guest speakers on a variety of topics and we host an impressive number of college reps during the fall semester of each school year. We also incorporate many college visits into our school year and provide guidance to parents for their family visits to colleges. Learning about many outstanding colleges and universities and the characteristics that differentiate them is an invaluable part of the selection process.</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('#more-college').toggle();">MORE</a>

<div id="more-college" style="display:none">&nbsp;
<p>Camelot assists our students and their families through every phase of the college selection/application process (To read a more detailed account of our approach to College Planning, <a href="/guidance/college-planning/">click here</a>).</p>

<p>The results of Camelot Academy&#39;s college placement program have been impressive. Not only has every Camelot graduate been accepted to a 4-year college, many have also received substantial scholarships (to see a list of College Acceptances for recent graduates, <a href="/guidance/college-acceptances/">click here</a>).</p>

<h3>A World Class Education - Without Expensive Frills</h3>

<p>Camelot has one of the lowest tuition rates among independent schools in the Triangle. It can also boast the highest percentage of tuition assistance through an array of merit-based and talent based awards, sibling discounts and financial aid. Payment plans (internal and external) help make our school an affordable option for a variety of circumstances. In addition, Camelot participates in the NCSEAA Opportunity Scholarship and Disability Grants Program. (For more detailed information, see <a href="/page/tuition-fees-scholarships-and-financial-aid/">Tuition, Fees, Scholarships &amp; Financial Aid</a>).</p>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<h3>High Standards</h3>

<p>Camelot Academy is accredited by the National Independent Private Schools Association (NIPSA), meaning the course work completed at Camelot Academy is transferable to other public or private schools. As part of our accreditation requirement we give a nationally normed, standardized test once a year in the spring (the ERB CTP &ndash; Educational Record Bureau Comprehensive Testing Program exam.
